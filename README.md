Rough attempt at recreating the classic doll game from the TV show squid game. I started this some time ago and since then put it on the back burner. Initially I used AI soldiers to create the ring but came back recently to update it to icons instead to help with performance.
As it is this code suffers from serious performance issues and will not work well with in excess of approximately 20 players.
I will be returning to this soon I think so that I can iron out the performance problems as I think the idea is sound and this was a good first attempt but it needs some work to iron out the issues.
Works ok as is - needs the AI players removing in proper play as they are able to melee and they shouldnt be able to. They also dont know where they are going!
I think when I come back to it I will change the map but just need to find a decent area to do so.
